Web application for the mobile ["Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes"](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/galaxy-of-heroes) game.

App: https://swgohway.com

## Current state

Pages:

## Coming soon

Here are a few ideas I'm going to implement:

- Text field for entering ally code;
- Authorization and saving ally code to user.
